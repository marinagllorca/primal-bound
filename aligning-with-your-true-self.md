# Aligning With Your True Self: A Journey to Self-Discovery
To start to understand our life purpose, it is important to have a clear picture of who we are. 

We might think we know who we are, but the truth is, our personality is strongly influenced by the time and place we were born in, trauma and past experiences, and other people's expectations. With this, we have built our own idea of what we think we are, and this, in fact, limits us from reaching our full potential. 

In this blog post, we will explore the importance of aligning with our true selves in the journey of self-awareness. 

### The power of meditation
To embark on the journey of self-discovery, it is essential to engage in self-reflection and cultivate self-awareness. **Every day meditation, even if it is for a short time, before work and after bed, will truly make a difference.** Take this time for yourself, to examine your values, beliefs, and desires. What truly matters to you? What are your core principles? By understanding these aspects of yourself, you can make choices and decisions that align with your true self. 

**Apps to implement the habit of meditation:** _maybe add link to them?_

### Embracing Authenticity
Authenticity is about honoring your true desires and passions. It means being true to yourself and expressing yourself authentically in relationships and interactions. In the post _"Your vibe attracts your tribe"_ we explain how authenticity will attract people similar to you in interests and values. 

### Living with Purpose
Discovering your passions and life purpose is a significant aspect of self-discovery. Take the time to explore your interests and identify what brings you joy and fulfillment. Set meaningful goals and intentions that align with your values and purpose. By aligning your actions with your values and purpose, you create a sense of meaning and fulfillment in your life. Living with purpose allows you to live a life that is true to yourself and positively impacts the world around you.

### Letting go of external acceptance
The sooner we understand that society's standards are unreal and prefabricated, the sooner we will get to know our true selves. 
Once you get started on meditation, the next step is to **identify situations in which we are seeking to be accepted, rather than to be heard**. 
We recommend implementing this into your meditation routine: think about which situations made you feel uncomfortable throughout the day and what your reaction was. Then ask yourself: **Was I being honest to myself?** Setting boundaries is crucial in overcoming external validation addiction. It involves identifying toxic relationships and situations that perpetuate the need for external acceptance and consciously choosing to distance ourselves from them.

## Practicing self-love and acceptance
Self-love and acceptance are crucial aspects of self-discovery and personal growth. Practice self-care and self-compassion by prioritizing your well-being and treating yourself with kindness and understanding. **Embrace your strengths and accept your flaws**, recognizing that they are all part of what makes you beautifully human. **Forgiving yourself and others** is also an important step in cultivating self-love and acceptance. Let go of past resentments and allow yourself to heal and move forward with an open heart.

### Mind-Body Alignment

Taking care of your physical well-being is an integral part of self-discovery. Nurturing your body through exercise, proper nutrition, and adequate rest allows you to show up fully in your life. Explore holistic practices like yoga or meditation to cultivate a deeper mind-body connection. These practices can help you quiet your mind, reduce stress, and listen to your body's wisdom. By aligning your mind and body, you create a harmonious foundation for self-discovery and growth.


### Conclusion

The journey of self-discovery and opening your heart is an ongoing process that requires commitment and patience. Embrace this journey with an open mind and heart. By aligning with your true self, you can experience a deeper sense of fulfillment, connection, and purpose in your life. Remember to be kind and gentle with yourself throughout this journey, and continue to cultivate self-awareness, authenticity, self-love, and empathy. Embrace the growth and transformation that comes with aligning with your true self and opening your heart, and let it guide you towards a more meaningful and joyful life.
